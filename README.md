# Project-year2-sem2-practica-EY-RPA

In year two at university we had to go to a real 
world company for a week and make our own project 
with the software that company uses/make software 
for them.
I chose to take part in this with E&Y and make my own 
automated process.
You might need the rpa development software from uipath 
to be able to run the code:
